/*
In the program, there are very few known bugs.

One such bug I have found is that the second gui box that I created is
occasionally large, and occasionally small.  I am not sure what exactly decides
the size of the box, but it appears random.  To accommodate this problem, I just
made the gui big enough to hold the bigger of the two box sizes.

Other than that, I am not sure of any bugs except that the reflection angle is
not always perfect, but is close to the correct reflection value.
