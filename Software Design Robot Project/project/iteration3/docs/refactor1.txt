Refactor 1 for Iteration 3
By: Alex Tuckner : 4730040 : tuckn016


The files that I have changed for this refactor are arena.cc

The method that I wanted to simplify to an outside user was the 
	checkForObjectInProximity method within the arena at lines 501 and 502
	since it has a lot of complicated math and can easily get confusing. 

So, to do this I changed the variable triangle_theta from this:

double triangle_theta = Positive(static_cast<int>(atan(radius/dist)*180/3.14));

to this:

double triangle_theta = get_triangle_theta(radius, dist);
double get_triangle_theta(double radius, double distance) {
  return Positive(static_cast<int>(atan(radius/dist)*180/3.14));
}




I have also done the same with distance_theta as it is very similar.  From this:

Positive(static_cast<int>(atan2(deltaY, deltaX)*180/3.14));


to this:

double distance_theta = get_distance_theta(deltaX, deltaY);
double Arena::get_distance_theta(double deltaX, double deltaY) {
  Positive(static_cast<int>(atan2(deltaY, deltaX)*180/3.14));
}

These new methods are created at the bottom of the file at lines 536 and 540
The objective of this refactor was to make the code simpler to understand for a
	new developer looking at this project. Taking all the complicated math and
	putting it off to the side because it only complicates the original functions
	goal which was to determine if there was an object in the proximity of a
	robot.
