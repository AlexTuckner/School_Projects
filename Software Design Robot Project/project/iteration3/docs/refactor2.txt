Refactor 2 for Iteration 3
By: Alex Tuckner : 4730040 : tuckn016


Change Variable and or Method names:

List of the Variables being changed:
	EventCollision ec(m_ent->get_entity_type(), m_ent->get_pos(), m_ent->get_heading_angle());
	EventDistressCall ed(m_ent->get_entity_type(), m_ent->get_pos());



The first Variable that I would like to give a more meaningful name is
EventCollision objects that I create in the arena.  Previously I just 
called them ec as such, but I feel I could give it a clearer name.

This is written on line: 185 
Original: EventCollision ec(m_ent->get_entity_type(), m_ent->get_pos(), m_ent->get_heading_angle());

New: EventCollision event_coll(m_ent->get_entity_type(), m_ent->get_pos(), m_ent->get_heading_angle());



The next variable that I would like to give a more meaningful name is in the same realm.
I did the same name scheme with the EventProximity objects that I created in the arena 
and are going to change those to be clearer to an outsider.

This was written on lines: 200, 208, 216
Original: EventDistressCall ed(m_ent->get_entity_type(), m_ent->get_pos());

New: EventDistressCall event_dis(m_ent->get_entity_type(), m_ent->get_pos());



These new names are better than the previous ones because firstly, they inform the
programmer that they are events, just through the name without having to look for
the instantiation of the variable.  In both cases they now at least specify what
type of event they are without being too long or excessive.
